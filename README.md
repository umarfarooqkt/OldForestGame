# OldForestGame (Tower destroy remake)

Old tree is a 2D tower defense game I created as a hobby project. 
The game is made using the unity game engine and scripted in C#.  
  Old tree is a strategic game I made using 2D animations and basic game design principals.  
  High Intensity enemy spawning and path finding are the basis for the gameâ€™s simple yet engaging user heuristics.
